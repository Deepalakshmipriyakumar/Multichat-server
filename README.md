Abstract
________________________________________
This project presents a real-time LAN-based chat application developed using Python.
It enables users to communicate over a local network through a GUI interface built using Tkinter.
Socket programming is used to manage real-time message broadcasting, while MySQL is used for storing chat logs. A command-line admin panel is integrated into the system, allowing for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on chat messages and the ability to export data to CSV. This project showcases network communication, GUI design, and backend database operations in a unified system.

 Introduction
________________________________________
With increasing demand for real-time communication applications, 
chat systems have become an integral part of digital interaction. 
This project explores the development of a LAN-based chat application that allows multiple users to interact in real time on a local network. Unlike internet-based apps, this tool is designed for closed environments such as offices, campuses, or labs.
Key Goals:
•	Real-time messaging on LAN
•	User-friendly chat interface
•	Centralized message logging
•	Admin controls for message moderation
